# Calander.CPP

This is a simple calander program written in C++. It's for my college project. It's not a very good program, but it works. Thanks.

## How to use

1. Download the source code.
2. Compile it with the following command:

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp
```

3. Run it with the following command:

```bash
./main
```

4. Enter the year.

5. Tada! You have a calander for that year.
